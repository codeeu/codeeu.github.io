			<p><strong>Code</strong>: each and every interaction between humans and computers is governed by it. Whether you create a web app, simulate the formation of stars or the neuronal pathways in the brain, sift through LHC data for the Higgs, optimize GPS software, or wish to revolutionize social interactions, the access to information and global shopping behavior. Coding is everywhere.</p>
 
			<p>It is an enabling technology at the heart of many of the digital revolutions. More than a highly diverse tool, it is a way of looking at the world: a way to break tasks into ever smaller subsets. It is a fun and creative field full of great people and passionate communities.</p>
			 
			<p>And yet there is a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/grand-coalition-digital-jobs-0">projected shortfall</a> of up to 900,000 ICT professionals in Europe by 2015. <a href="http://startupmanifesto.eu">Technology startups</a>, a future pillar of European economy, are already finding it difficult to recruit enough talent.</p>

			<p>Coding deserves to be celebrated. We had over 300 events happening during the first Europe Code Week between the 25th and 30th of November 2013 – all aimed at exposing citizens to the multitude and diversity of coding, as well as teaching them these skills. Our goal is to improve the visibility of coding on a European scale, motivate people to start learning to code, and connect individuals, groups, organizations, and companies who are willing to help more people experience the joy and relevance of coding.</p>
			 
			<p><strong>We need you to make this week a success.</strong> Will you help us promote coding, highlight its history and the diversity of the applications? We need participation primarily in the form of events (though content for our website, sponsorship, and publicity would also be appreciated): ranging from programming workshops to company visits to lectures - we want to get as many initiatives as possible from all over Europe on board. We are also looking for ideas on how to make the initiative better for next year. Are you active in this area, and interested in joining Europe Code Week?
