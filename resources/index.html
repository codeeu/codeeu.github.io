<p>EU Code Week is a grass-root movement run by volunteers who promote coding in their countries as <a href="http://events.codeweek.eu/ambassadors">Code Week Ambassadors</a>. Anyone – schools, teachers, libraries, code clubs, businesses, public authorities – can organise a #CodeEU event and add it to the <a href="http://codeweek.eu/">codeweek.eu</a> map. To make organising and running coding events easier, we have prepared different toolkits and selected some of the best lesson plans, guides and other resources.</p>
