<p><strong>Here&rsquo;s what it all means in a bit more detail:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>One of our goals is to connect various coding and educational networks. <strong>If you know of any coding events taking place, let the organizers know about Code Week and help them add the event to the Code Week website</strong>, so we&rsquo;ll have a comprehensive list of all coding events in Europe.</li>
	<li>We&rsquo;re also hoping to see more events organized for Code Week. You can help by <strong>encouraging</strong> <strong>schools, organizations, developer communities, and enthusiastic individuals to start new, beginner friendly events in your country</strong>. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be during Code Week itself, although that will be the prime time for our promotional activities. To help you out, we&rsquo;re preparing a list of suggestions for companies, a <a href="http://events.codeweek.eu/guide">guide for potential event organizers</a>, and we&rsquo;re also building a variety of other <a href="https://github.com/codeeu/codeeu-resources">promotional resources</a>. </li>
	<li>We need your help to <strong>respond to emails regarding Code Week in your country.</strong> You&rsquo;ll be the primary point of contact for anything that&rsquo;s going on in your country, so you can <strong>connect people and companies from your country that might benefit from getting connected with each other</strong> and provide answers in your language. Don&rsquo;t worry if you don&rsquo;t know all the answers yet, we&rsquo;re here to help.</li>
	<li>Everyone can add their coding event to <a href="http://events.codeweek.eu">http://events.codeweek.eu</a>, but you&rsquo;ll be the moderator for events in your country. All you need to do is to regularly<strong> take a quick look at submitted events and check if they are a good fit for Code Week</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>It needs to be easy for everyone to start a coding event. You probably know some great online learning materials for beginner coders in your language, <strong>so you can maintain a list of resources for your country on the Europe Code Week website</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Provide interesting news and content about coding from your country</strong> that we can promote on Code Week social media channels. We&rsquo;re primarily looking for content in English, so you can help by asking organizers to share their stories and tips in English for <a href="http://blog.codeweek.eu">our blog</a>. Additionally, you can also set up your national Code Week social media channels to promote content in your own language.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Together with your help, we&rsquo;ll be building a library of Code Week materials that can be used to promote coding as a skill. <strong>We need your help to spread the materials in your country and even encourage different groups to provide translations</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>We&rsquo;re creating a network of national ambassadors to promote Code Week and we&rsquo;ll also try to schedule monthly online calls to discuss our work, exchange good practices and inspire each other with ideas for further activities&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t have to attend all meetings, but we hope you can join us as often as possible. We also have a mailing list for EU Code Week Ambassadors that you can use any time to get advice or help from other ambassadors. <strong>You&rsquo;ll be able to expand your own network and get fresh ideas by collaborating with other ambassadors from across Europe.</strong></li>
</ul>
