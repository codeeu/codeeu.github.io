[GEMS World Academy in Etoy](http://www.gemsworldacademy-etoy.com/), Switzerland really embraced Europe Code Week in a big way. You can read more about how they used [Hopscotch](https://www.gethopscotch.com), an iPad app similar to [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu), to introduce coding to kids in a fun way on the [Learning Freewheel blog](http://learningfreewheel.wordpress.com/the-wardrobe/). The best part? It was also the kids teaching their teachers how to use the new tools!

> _"During code week I have been working with the student’s to code a computer character to draw a football pitch and add to players to our game. Unfortunately I also did not know how to do this so we had to learn together. ... Quite often it was the student’s teaching me!"_

And now we're happy to share the [EU Code Week video created at GEMS - Etoy](https://vimeo.com/81186435) during #codeEU, which shows a lot of different tools being used and, most importantly, a lot of happy kids, who are learning important digital skills.
