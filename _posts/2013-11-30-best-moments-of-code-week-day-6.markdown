It's getting hard to believe that we reached the final day of the first ever Europe Code Week. It's been so exciting to see your smiles from all corners of Europe. So exciting that we really hope you won't stop learning and sending us your coding moments just because Code Week is over. 

Choosing the best moments of the final day has been really challenging. Mostly due to the high number of [CoderDojos](http://coderdojo.com/) taking place everywhere. So many kids were coding that some of you even had trouble accessing the [learntocode.eu](http://learntocode.eu/) website, where you can share your knowledge with other CoderDojos!

St. Oliver's Community College in Drogheda, Ireland hosted such a big #codeEU CoderDojo that one single photo couldn't event fit all aspiring young coders!

We were again happy to see that girls were also learning to code. These big smiles can only mean they were having a lot of fun while creating their own games. Keep it up, girls!

CoderDojo Drogheda was again very lucky to have the assistance of our amazing #codeEU ambassador from Ireland, Julie Cullen.

In Limerick, Ireland the CoderDojo moved to the milk market to promote coding in their community. Great idea!

Kids were also coding at the CoderDojo in Ticino, Switzerland. Like the decorations!

It's great to see that some #codeEU events attract attention from decision makers. Ciarán Cannon, Minister of State for Training in Ireland, has been a big [supporter of #codeEU](https://twitter.com/ciarancannon/status/406864590879084544) from day one, for which we are very grateful. We were also happy to see that in CoderDojo Genk, Belgium, the mayor came to see what the kids created.

We also got a glimpse of the #codeEU activities at the 1st Junior High school of Vrilissia in Athens, Greece, where they hosted a very special introductory meeting of a community of young programmers. We hope it won't be the last!

By looking at these photos you might think that coding is just for kids. That's certainly not the case. You're never too old to start learning! In Nova Gorica, Slovenia the E-Center kicked off their GoWeb workshop that will help participants build their web CV in HTML5 and acquire new skills. The workshop was free for the unemployed.

On the other side of Slovenia, Mozilla Space Novo Mesto organized their first [Mozilla Webmaker](https://webmaker.org/) workshop in collaboration with colleagues from the neighboring Mozilla community in Croatia. That's the spirit! The Mozilla Space was packed with participants, including girls, of course.

There were a lot of women coding in Luxembourg at The Impactory's Intro to Web Development for Women workshop, where participants discovered that coding is very creative!

And certainly not boring. Teaching and learning code takes you through a lot of emotions, as the organizers of the Rails #codeEU workshop in Vienna proved. There's nothing like building something on your own!

And while Europe Code Week is now officially over, we're not letting go. It's too much fun. And there are still some events taking place this Sunday. And next week. And the week after that. Because #codeEU isn't about a date. It's about embracing digital technology to create something fun or useful. We hope you'll keep coding and sharing. If you're looking for your next challenge, [Make Things Do Stuff](http://makethingsdostuff.co.uk/) (what a great name!) has a couple of suggestions:
